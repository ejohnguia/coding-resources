## Note Taking

OneNote isn't as feasible of an option for note taking when it's limited to OneDrive cloud syncing as well as not being able to use it on a Linux machine.

These are markdown based applications.

Here are some possible options:

-   [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
    -   Using Obsidian on mobile:
        -   Use [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)
